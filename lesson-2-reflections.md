# Lesson 2 reflections
## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created enabling git version control to be used.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains snapshots of files that will be added to the next commit, whereas the working directory just contains the most recent version of the files whether they are to be committed or not. The repository contains all versions of the committed files at the times they were committed. I think the staging area offers a way to easily see which file changes will be added to the next commit and what that kind of change is (e.g. new file or deletion)
