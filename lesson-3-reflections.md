# Lesson 3 reflections
## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repository is useful both for collaborating and backup. The remote repository can be used as the central location for
a project, meaning that many people can work on different or the same parts of it a the same time, pushing their changes to it. Everybody
working on it can then get those changes by pulling from the remote. In terms of backup, using a remote means your code is in at least one
more place than just locally. The remote can then facilitate other clones of the repository, or more remotes can be created for greater 
distribution; this all makes the storage of the code much more robust and less likely to be lost due to mistake, system failure or
malicious attacks.
