# Git practice
This repository contains some of my practice and study of git and GitHub.

## Udacity course - How to use Git and GitHub
See my reflections from the Udacity course [How to use Git and Github](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).
The questions answered in the reflections are suggested questions from the course, intended to make the student 
reinforce their learning of the topics taught.

## Rebase, squash, hard and soft reset practice
See [here](/git_practice).
