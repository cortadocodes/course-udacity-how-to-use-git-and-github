# Git practice
This repository contains some of my practice and study of git and GitHub.

## Udacity course - How to use Git and GitHub
My reflections from the Udacity course "How to use Git and Github" can be found [here](https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).
The questions answered in the reflections are suggested questions from the course, intended to reinforce the student's 
learning of the topics taught.

## Rebase, squash, hard and soft reset practice
To practice and understand some slightly more advanced git topics, I've created a script that generates a sample git 
repository with synthetic files and history; the idea is that it doesn't matter if this repo is broken by incorrect 
git commands as it doesn't contain real code and can be reproducably rebuilt in a few seconds. The operations I will 
carry out and demonstrate on this repo are:
* Rebasing a feature branch on to master
* Squashing a feature branch on to master
* Hard resets
* Hard pushing/pulling
